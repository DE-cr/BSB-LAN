# Troubleshooting

BSB-LAN tries to make accessing your heating system as easy as possible, but there are always things that can go wrong. If you still have a problem after reading this document as well as the [FAQ](faq.md), please open up a bug report on the project's GitHub page and make sure that you provide us with the necessary log files, especially from the Serial Monitor (***Tools/Serial Monitor*** in the Arduino IDE). Make sure you copy the messages right from the moment your microcontroller boots until the moment you encounter the problem. Please do not send screenshots, only plain text files.

In addition to the help from the developers, there are also a number of users who have written tutorials in several languages that might me helpful for you to fix your problems:

## Home Assistant

GitHub user @ryann72 wrote detailed instructions for [BSB-LAN and HomeAssistant/Mosquitto](https://github.com/ryann72/Home-assistant-tutoriel/blob/main/BSB-LAN/tutoriel%20BSB-LAN%20English.md). It is also available in [French](https://github.com/ryann72/Home-assistant-tutoriel/blob/main/BSB-LAN/tutoriel%20BSB-LAN.md).

YouTuber @StoneTime has created two videos (in German) where he shows the [installation of BSB-LAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-5I-TUzXuk) as well as [setting it up in Home Assistant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Q-_flTPvk). Dankesch√∂n!
