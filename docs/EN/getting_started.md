# Where and how do I begin?
- You are an experienced user? Head on to the [quickstart instructions](quickstart.md). Otherwise (or if you run into problems), please read on!
- Is my heating system supported by BSB-LAN? Please go to the [list of supported heating systems](supported_heating_systems.md).
- If you already know that your system is supported, [find out more about the BSB-LAN adapter](bsb-lan_adapter.md) and where to get it.
- If you already have the adapter, you may want to know [how to install the adapter](install.md).
- If you have installed the adapter, you will need to [configure BSB-LAN](configure.md).
- Once you have everything up and running, find out about [how to use BSB-LAN](using.md) or learn more about the ways to [ingetrate BSB-LAN into home automation systems](homeautomation.md).
- If you run into troubles, have a look at the [troubleshooting page](troubleshooting.md).
- And before you ask anyone else any questions, have a look at our [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](faq.md) first!
